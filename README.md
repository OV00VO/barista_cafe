### Possible Future Developments

The initial website structure serves as a foundation for inspiration, with modular components that can cater to various niches by simply adding more content for the purpose, such as coffee tasting events, coffee education, or barista training.

Future developments may include a booking system, live training schedules, and a personalized membership login system. Gamification options, like earning badges or exclusive benefits, could enhance user engagement. A user-friendly CMS and CRM system might streamline client interaction and open doors to numerous beneficial add-ons.
